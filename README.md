During the process of elevating my position as a well rounded software engineer it came to my attention that by attending JavaScript meetups that part of the commitment to the group was my participation with presentations. 

These groups attracted all levels of software engineering expertise. 

I decided to build a these presentations using my skill sets with HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, JSON and VUE.  

That required a design of the HTML page that could easily be presented through by the click of the mouse.

I also designed the page in two horizontal rows: The first row, the slide topic. The second row, the slide graphic supporting the topic.

I used a series of numbers to define the slide; however, the click on the slide rendered the slide information.

I also added a color to the slide as it was "clicked" so that I could visualize my progress as I moved through the presentation.

and, 

it worked because my audience easily referred to the slide number for questions about the content.

All the rendering was dispatched to the available page space underneath the two rows so that the page remained static.

Therefore; my goal, 

Was a presentation that could benefit all attendees of the group by providing interesting topics, by providing graphics, by analyzing the source code and providing the reasons for the choice a particular algorithm that was necessary for a JavaScript function to execute correctly.

I have attached the screenshots of these presentations.
