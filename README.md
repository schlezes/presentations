During the process of elevating my position as a well rounded software engineer it came to my attention that by attending JavaScript meetups that part of the commitment to the group was my participation with presentations. 

These groups attracted all levels of software engineering expertise. 

I decided to build a these presentations using my skill sets with HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, JSON and VUE.  

That required a design of the HTML page that could easily be sequenced through the series of topics by the use of the click of the mouse.

I also designed the page in two horizontal rows: The first row, the topic. The second row, the  graphic supporting the topic.

and,

All the rendering was dispatched to the available page space underneath the two rows so that the page remained static.

Therefore the presentations could benefit all attendees of the group by providing interesting topics, by providing graphics, by analyzing the source code and providing the reasons for the choice a particular algorithm that was necessary for a JavaScript function to execute correctly.

I have attached the screenshots of these presentations.

Thanks,
